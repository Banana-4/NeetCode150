# Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List:

## Problem:
    Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## Data:
    The data given is the head of a single link integer linked list.
    The posiable list lengths are in inclusive range 0, 5000.
    The values are from -5000 <= val <= 5000.

## Data Transformation:

Transform the list so that the links go from tail to head. Can be thoughts as reversing the links directions and swapping of head and tail.

| 1 -> 2 -> 3 | ---> |TRANSFORM| ---> |1 <- 2 <- 3|


## Solutions:
### Naive aproach:
        Use a stack to for tmp storage.
        Traverse the list to the tail and at each iteration push the value onto the stack
        Traverse the list again, but this time replace each val with the popped value.
        return the head.

#### Time and Space:
    1. Time complexiety O(n)
    2. Extra space used n.

#### Python Code:
```
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        values: List[int] = []
        node = head
        while node:
            values.append(node.val)
            node = node.next
        node = head
        while node:
            node.val = values.pop()
            node = node.next
        return head
```

### Link Swaping:
    The idea is to reverse the links directions while traversing the list and return the tail node as the new head.
    if no head
        return none
    prev = None
    while there is a next node:
        get the next node and store it in next
        set the head next pointer to the prev
        set prev to the current head
        set the head to next
    return head

#### Time and Space:
    1. Time: O(n)
    2. Space O(1)

#### Python Code:
```
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return head
        prev = None
        while head.next:
           nodeNext = head.next
           head.next = prev
           prev = head
           head = nodeNext
        head.next = prev
        return head
```
