# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Problem:
  Given two sorted linked lists list1 and list2, merge the two list into one sorted list, The lists should be joined by combining theire nodes into one list, without creating new nodes.
  Return the head of the new list.

## Constrains:
  1. The number of nodes in both lists is 0 to 50.
  2. The val stored in the nodes is betwwen -100 and 100 inclusiv.
  3. Both list are sorted in increasing order

## Data:
  Two textbook single linked lists.

## Invariant:
  List1 and List2 are always valid sorted lists.
  
## Solution:
  The solution uses a dummy node as the initial head value of the new list. Then a current node is created from the head for iteration.
  The algorithm uses a loop to loop while both list are not null.
  In each iteration, a decision has to be made what should be the next pointer of the current node.
  There are two cases:
    3. list1.val < list2.val, list1 is the next node, list1 advances to its next node
    4. if neither is the case, list2 is the next node, list2 advances to its next node
  node  = node.next
  After the loop set node.next to point to the remaing unvisited nodes from list1 or list2
  the node is set to head and head is set to head.next, to clear the dummy node node.next is set to None
  return head

## Time Complexity:
  O(n)

## Space Complexity:
  O(1)
