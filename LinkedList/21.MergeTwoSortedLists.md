# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Problem:
  Given two sorted linked lists list1 and list2, merge the two list into one sorted list, The lists should be joined by combining theire nodes into one list, without creating new nodes.
  Return the head of the new list.

## Constrains:
  1. The number of nodes in both lists is 0 to 50.
  2. The val stored in the nodes is betwwen -100 and 100 inclusiv.
  3. Both list are sorted in increasing order

## Data:
  Two textbook single linked lists.

## Solution:
  The solution uses a dummy node as the initial head value of the new list. Then a current node is created from the head for iteration.
  The algorithm uses a loop to loop while both list are not fully visited.
  In each iteration, a decision has to be made what should be the next pointer of the current node.
  There are four cases:
    1. List1 is empty, then traverse list2, seting node next to list2, list2 advances to its next node, node advances to its next.
    2. list2 is empty, then traverse list1, seting node next to list1, list1 advances to its next node, node advances to its next.
    3. list1.val < list2.val, list1 is the next node, list1 advances to its next node
    4. if neither is the case, list2 is the next node, list2 advances to its next node
  node  = node.next
  Once the loop is done, the node is set to head.next and head.next is set to None, clearing the dummy node
  return node

## Time Complexity:
  O(n)

## Space Complexity:
  O(1)
